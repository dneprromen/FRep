<h1>How To Avoid Wasting Your Most Valuable Online Asset - TIME!</h1>


<div class="te">
<p>If you're involved in an internet marketing business, then
you've probably already come face-to-face with your #1
enemy - "Time Wasting".</p>

<p>What you need to know is that "Time Is Money". And this
applies even more to the online world, than in regular
business.</p>
</div>

<p>You see, anyone can become an online entrepreneur. It
doesn't involve start-up capital or expensive equipment to
start. A low grade PC and a net connection is all you need.</p>

<p>And since cash isn't really a barrier, time-management has
become all the more critical. Your challenge for success is
simply to get more done - in less time.</p>

<p>So what are the greatest online time wasters and what can
you do to avoid them?</p>
<ol>
<li> Retyping the same old thing time and time again.</li>
<li> Failing to manage your email effectively.</li>
<li> Getting sucked into pointless forum discussions.</li>
<li> Failing to set a goal, before you switch the computer on.</li>
</ol>
